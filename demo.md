## Tutorial Level

### Why does this tutorial level matter?

This tutorial level seems to be useful on several levels. Most explicitly, it guides us (the students) through making a github account and generally becoming acquainted with the software we'll be using:
> The tutorial will walk you through setting up your Github account, and installing (and using) Obsidian on your machine.

(Graham, 2022). 

For example just now I've practiced quoting something with markdown formatting. I don't know if I did it perfectly but I had to look through the documentation and, you know, practice.

On another level though I think it serves to show us immediately that this is an experimental course. This "tutorial level" is very different than anything I've done in any other course so practically it's also an introduction to the idea that the whole course may be structured differently than I'm used to. Even if I hadn't read or internalized that message from the syllabus, by now I would definitely know.

Lastly, I think for the less "techy" students, going through this process might help: 
+ get us used to asking for help when needed
+ give us confidence that we can learn how to use a new tool 

I didn't actually know how much to write since there's no wrap in the code section of github so three lines could mean three characters or an entire book. I have a hard time interpreting my way through ambiguity, but I know enough to know you probably didn't mean either of those extremes! So I wrote three ideas, since that's how I normally decide to end a line in something like this, or even while coding. Each line is communicating its own little concept (counting quotes and lists as part of the same line).
